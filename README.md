# custom-twitch-utils
Poorly-written custom Twitch utility userscript. Please customize before using it.

I know the code is extremely ugly, but... The only goal for it is to work.

## Current features
- [x] Fake user and unwanted user blocker.
- [x] Automatic streamer points collector.
- [x] Minecraft stream watching bot.
  - [x] Reject streams requiring phone verification to chat. It is a form of unacceptable breach of privacy.
